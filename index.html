    <h1>The Keynote</h1>
    <p>Lights dim. Audience murmur fades as spotlights slowly reveal the stage.</p>
    <p>Engineering Mind Tommy saunters onto the stage, casual yet commanding, dressed in his signature black turtleneck and blue jeans.</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> <em>(Raises hand for quiet)</em> Morning everyone! There's no place I'd rather be.</p>
    <p>(The applause slowly fades into eager silence)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Before we dive into today's excitement, let's take a nostalgic journey back.</p>
    <p>(The colossal screen behind him comes alive, showcasing a smart air purifier.)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Who remembers the iPure Air? Our pioneer, the device that didn't just purify your air but made sense of it!</p>
    <p>(Applause and cheers resonate through the room)</p>
    <p>(The scene transitions to a compact vacuum cleaner.)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> And then, we challenged what's possible with the iSweep Mini, bringing power and portability together like never before.</p>
    <p>(Cheers grow louder)</p>
    <p>(The screen shifts to a futuristic dustbin.)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Not forgetting the iBin Pro. We turned waste management into an intelligent process, paving the way for a greener future.</p>
    <p>(Thunderous applause echoes around the room)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Each of these, game-changers in their own domains.</p>
    <p>(Audience murmurs with anticipation)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Remember these names – the iPure Air, the iSweep Mini, the iBin Pro.</p>
    <p>(The murmurs amplify, turning into whispers of excitement)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Now, what if we were to transcend these pillars of innovation?</p>
    <p>(Excited whispers pervade the room)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Imagine an innovation that doesn't just alter your perception of cleanliness but reshapes your interaction with your home.</p>
    <p>(Whispers intensify)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> What if we had something... that's as indispensable as the iPure Air... as dynamic as the iSweep Mini... and as clever as the iBin Pro...</p>
    <p>(Audience leans forward, the whispers reach a crescendo)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce...</p>
    <p>(The auditorium holds its breath)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> The iVac!</p>
    <p>(A wave of applause and cheers erupts, washing over the stage. The screen flashes to life with the sleek design of the iVac.)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> The iVac, a quantum leap in our pursuit of clean, smart, and vibrant living!</p>
    <p

>(The applause is deafening as the crowd marvels at the sleek, new iVac.)</p>
    <p>(The applause ebbs away. Tommy sidles up to a side table where a piece of wood, a saw, and the iVac await.)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> What say we put the iVac to the test, eh?</p>
    <p>(A roar of approval)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Picture this: you're at home, brimming with creative energy, yearning to work on some wood. But there's that pesky dust. Enter the iVac.</p>
    <p>(He picks up the saw, carving into the wood. As dust begins to fly, he activates the iVac. It springs to life, catching the dust mid-flight.)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Boom!</p>
    <p>(Applause and laughter fills the room)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> The iVac isn't merely reactive. It's proactive.</p>
    <p>(He continues sawing, the iVac smartly catching dust mid-air)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Boom! Predictive dust tracking in action!</p>
    <p>(Thunderous applause rocks the room)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> But hold on... it gets even better.</p>
    <p>(He ceases sawing, the iVac powers down immediately. Tapping on the iVac, a display pops up with details about the wood dust collected, the quality of the cut, and tips for woodworking.)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Isn’t that something?</p>
    <p>(Audience erupts with cheers)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> That's the iVac for you. Not just picking up dust, but picking up insights about your work. And there's more...</p>
    <p>(He unlatches the iVac, revealing a compact brick of compressed dust.)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Boom! Ready for disposal or... who knows? Maybe you've got a passion for eco-brick building!</p>
    <p>(Laughter ripples through the room, followed by applause)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the iVac – not just clean, it's a smart, insightful clean!</p>
    <p>(Applause dies down, Tommy steps back up to the microphone, a broad smile on his face.)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Thank you all for sharing in the excitement of the iVac. But the fun's not over yet.</p>
    <p>(The audience quiets, intrigued)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> We all know that a good work session needs a soundtrack. So to cap off this special day, we've got a special treat.</p>
    <p>(Excited whispers fill the room)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> This group of artists has been filling our workshops with sweet melodies for years. They know the craft, they know the rhythm of work...</p>
    <p>(Audience waits with bated breath)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> And what's more, they've agreed to give their classic hit a new spin. A tribute to our latest innovation.</p>
    <p>(The crowd leans in, eagerly anticipating the reveal)</p>
    <p><strong>Tommy:</strong> Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you... The Carpenters!</p>
    <p>(Audience bursts into applause and cheers as the classic band The Carpenters take the stage.)</p>
    <p><strong>Lead Singer:</strong> <em>(Smiling at the crowd)</em> We thought we'd do something special for this occasion. Here's our little twist on our hit song "Top of the World".</p>

    <p>(Music starts playing)</p>
    <p><strong>Lead Singer:</strong> <em>(Singing)</em></p>
    <p>"Such a feelin's comin' over me<br>
    There is wonder in 'most ev'ry thing I see<br>
    Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes<br>
    And I won't be surprised if it's a dream</p>
    <p>Everything I want the world to be<br>
    Is now coming true especially for me<br>
    And the reason is clear, it's because iVac is here<br>
    It's the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen</p>
    <p>I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation<br>
    And the only explanation I can find<br>
    Is the love that I've found ever since iVac's been around<br>
    Your love's put me at the top of the world."</p>
    <p>(Applause and laughter fills the auditorium as The Carpenters continue their special rendition of their classic hit.)</p>
